Password-Generator

This is a Password-Generator that allows the user to choose a create a random password with specific criterias. The user can choose uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, special symbols and make it a length between 8-128 characters.

I used javescript functions, conditions statments, arrays, and itterations to develope a working code.  

The password generator works by having 4 symbol arrays. When the user decide if they want a criteria that array become true gets merges into a single array called temparray. Then a function goes through that array and picks random and keeping picking using an itteration until the user length is reached.
